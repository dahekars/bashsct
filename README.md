# bashsct

### this is a project created by me for installion for all application for setuping my system for everything do on linux.

(Yes, I am lazy guy, what can i do??):shrug:

the stupid idea for me that someone have installed a new apt base system/os with "bash" and uses same tool and application,
run a command for this page, goes for a coffee or chat & return in half hour and system is ready with all tools you need 

here is a best script to try 

```
$ wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dahekars/bashsct/main/JHingnitioncode/Get_start_sys.sh" && chmod +x Get_start_sys.sh && ./Get_start_sys.sh
```

## thank you for choosing my code
